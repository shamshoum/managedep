# Node Dependency Manager

**This little command line tool is a work in progress !!!**

I still didn't decide to which direction it will go. What I do know is 
that I would like to have a tool that will give me abilities to easily manage my apps dependencies.

Currently the tool will check which dependcies that are installed in
your package.json and aren't in actual use.

#### Latest updates can be found in commits.

**Example for inputing folders:**
'folder1,folder2,folder3,folder3/subfolder'

**Example for inputing files:**
'file1,file2,folder/file3'

**Packages in use:**
1. [Commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/ "Commander github")
2. [Prompt](https://github.com/flatiron/prompt "Prompt github")
3. [Colors](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js "Colors github")

Note: If you have any suggestions or bug reports don't hesitate to add 
them to the issues in github and I will look at them and see what I can do.
